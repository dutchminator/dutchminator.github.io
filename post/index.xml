      <description>Hello, world! In an effort to improve my writing skills, a new blog is born.
For now, this post serves as an introduction of myself, and my blogging ambitions. I&amp;rsquo;m an ML engineer and Specialist Lead with Deloitte in The Netherlands, and this blog will cover any topic that I run into which might also be helpful, interesting or insightful to others.
What topics, you might ask? You could think about SQL tips &amp;amp; tricks, optimizations to Python code that are not obvious at first sight, or my foray into the world of MLOps; Bringing machine learning models to production environments in a sustainable, transparent, reproducible and automated manner.</description>
